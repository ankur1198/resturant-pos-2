# Make Site Responsive for All Devices

## Tasks
- [x] Analyze current responsive implementation in style.css
- [x] Improve admin layout responsiveness (sidebar stacking and sizing)
- [x] Enhance cashier interface responsiveness (order panel and menu grid)
- [x] Optimize modal and form layouts for mobile
- [x] Ensure touch-friendly buttons and inputs
- [x] Add additional media queries for better breakpoints
- [x] Test responsiveness across different device sizes
- [x] Verify proper viewport scaling and text readability

## Current Status
- Enhanced responsive design with new breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, and 480px
- Improved layouts for better mobile experience
- Added touch-friendly button and input sizes
- Adjusted grid layouts and spacing for various screen sizes

## Next Steps
- Run the application and test on different devices/screen sizes
- Verify that all screens (login, admin, cashier) display properly
